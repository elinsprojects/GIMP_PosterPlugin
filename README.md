# How to implement plug-in in GIMP
Download GIMP. 

Put the folder "GIMP_PosterPlugin" that houses the script and assets into GIMPs own Plug-in Folder. 

You may have to change settings on a macOS in the Terminal to give executable permission to the Python script with plug-in "poster.py". 

To run the plug-in, in GIMP App go to File/Create/Assign2, and the poster should appear.
